# Sea_Trutle
2d game in python

In this perticular scrolling game I pick sea theme in which i take three charcter
turtle(which is main player who scroll up and down using up and down arrow respectively)
red_harm_crabe(harm) and green_benifit_fish(benifit)
if turtle tuch(eat) green_benifit_fish score will increse by 5 and
if touch red_harm_crabe he lose his lives by one.
In this game i take a common word for both character(green_benifit_fish and red_harm_crabe) that is food(food_width,food_hight and food_vel).
Here the speed of red_harm_crabe is greater than green_benifit_fish we can change it in the move member function of food (food_vel+...)
